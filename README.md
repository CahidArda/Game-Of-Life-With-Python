# Game-Of-Life-With-Python

In this project I tried to implement Conway's Game Of Life using Python and Turtle.

I used a grid system I had written previously for my [mine sweeper project](https://github.com/CahidArda/MineSweeper). This grid system works but is highly inefficient when it comes to memory and speed.
